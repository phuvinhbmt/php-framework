I chose to use Model-View-Controller (MVC) for this task because: 
	- This task requires an OOP solution and MVC can make use of OOP
	- MVC helps to separate business layers from presentation layer and hence, code is more robust and easy to maintained and further developed
	- Most PHP frameworks uses MVC so this is a chance for me to get familiar to the core concepts before getting the hang of some PHP frameworks
